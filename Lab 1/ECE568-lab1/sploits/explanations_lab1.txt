// Target 1 Explanation



// Target 2 Explanation
This is a buffer overflow vulnerability. A for loop in the function, foo, enables for the copying of 272 chars to a 256 size buffer. 
For the exploit, we find the respective addresses of the buffer, return, i, and len using gdb and overwrite the values of i and len.
In the attack buffer, we first fill it with NOPs and then write the first 45 bytes with shellcode. Indexes 264-267 are overwritten with the 
address of i, indexes 268-271 are overwritten with the address of len and indexes 280-283 are overwritten with the return address. Index 284 is
the null terminator. After the attack buffer encounters a null character, the environment variables are given in the argv variable. 


// Target 3 Explanation



// Target 4 Explanation
This is a buffer overflow vulnerability. A for loop in the function, foo, enables for the copying of 169 chars to a 156 size buffer. 
For the exploit, we find the respective addresses of the buffer, return, i, and len using gdb and overwrite the values of i and len.
In the attack buffer, we first fill it with NOPs and then write the first 45 bytes with shellcode. Indexes 168-171 are overwritten with the 
address of i, indexes 172-175 are overwritten with the address of len and indexes 184-187 are overwritten with the return address. Index 188 is
the null terminator. Parts of the buffer are sent in with the env variables since several null characters are required.
