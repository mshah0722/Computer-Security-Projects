// Generate QR Code Explanation
A secret key is encoded in a special URI using the sprintf function in C.
The three parameters filled are: account name and issuer, which can be passed in using the urlEncode function and the secret key which is encoded in base-32,
first being converted from hex to binary array and then to base-32.

// Validate QR Code Explanation
This code generates the TOTP value from the secret and then verifies whether the user has provided correct values.
We first XOR the inner and outer pads respectively with the secret key, which is a 10-bit hex. 
Then, calculate the message from the current UNIX time over the active period of the TOTP.
Also, we calculate the HMAC using the SHA1 update functions. Finally, after finding the offset and bin from the outer SHA,
we convert the selected bytes to an integer and compare it to the input TOTP string; if they are equal, it is valid, and it is invalid otherwise.
